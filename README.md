### About the project
This project was conducted to familiarise myself with basic html, as well as with CSS concepts such as flex. It comprises part of a Code Academy course on front end web development.

### Getting Started
To view the project, use the index.html file.

### Project Composition
As can be seen, the project consists of two files, index.html and style.css. Resources in the form of images and logos are also included.
